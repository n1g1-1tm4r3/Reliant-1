In the coming days, Reliant 1.2.1 will be released, this will bring a few new things to the program, including reworked logs, as well as a few bugs, we have fixed the issue with the main menu selection, you must enter what you want, if you enter anything incorrectly, it will send you to the error page, so be aware of that. We are also working on adding custom usernames and passwords so that Reliant will be much more customizable, and we are working on readding the color changer, but making it permanent. We hope you are enjoying Reliant so far, we are going to be releasing 1.2.1 before Thanksgiving, however, there is no set date.
